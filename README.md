# Analyzing Open Street Maps Data using Python and SQL

This project completes the objectives of the ETL Data extraction and SQL analysis modules in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

The fundamentals of this project are the extraction and download of the OSM data for Portland, ORegon, followed by data cleaning 
in Python and output to .csv files in order to be analyzed using SQL. 

In this case Microsoft Access was used to join the tables and analyze them with SQL.

The full analysis write up can be found in the Project Final.md file.
